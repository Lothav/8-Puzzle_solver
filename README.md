# C++ 8-Puzzle solver

- No-information search:
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - Iterative Deepening Search
  - Uniform-Cost Search (or Djikstra Algorithm, because all edges costs are 1)

- Information search:
  - A* search
  - Greedy Best-First Search

- Local search:
  - Hill Climbing (with lateral movements)
